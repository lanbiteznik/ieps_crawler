In the past, I also taught at the Higher School of Economics in Moscow and Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. My research focuses on machine learning, visualization, and I know a bit of statistics. As a programmer, I contribute to the development of Orange , the largest open-source system for data analytics, as well as other smaller projects such as Trubar and Baycomp . One of the more fun ones—which actually belongs in the next paragraph—is Bobrova pustolovščina ( The Beaver’s Adventure ). Lately, I’ve been particularly interested in teaching computer science. Currently, I’m most active in integrating artificial intelligence and data analytics into schools: the Pumice project is funded through various grants by Slovenian ministries, Google, Tides, and the EU. Together with my wife, we translated CS Unplugged into Vidra (the Slovenian version). I’ve also taught Scratch to children in schools, I’m responsible for FRI organizing summer schools for elementary school students since summer 2013, I’ve participated in the Program Council of the Bebras Challenge, helped with initiatives like Code Week, lectured in teacher training workshops, and had fun with kids at the Znanstival science festival organized by the House of Experiments .

Janez Demšar Full Professor E: Send a message Your email * Your message * Office hours: Anytime (you may want to send me a mail before) Room: R3.18 - Kabinet Description I teach at the Faculty of Computer and Information Science (FRI) and the Faculty of Education at the University of Ljubljana (UL). In the past, I also taught at the Higher School of Economics in Moscow and Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. My research focuses on machine learning, visualization, and I know a bit of statistics. As a programmer, I contribute to the development of Orange , the largest open-source system for data analytics, as well as other smaller projects such as Trubar and Baycomp . One of the more fun ones—which actually belongs in the next paragraph—is Bobrova pustolovščina ( The Beaver’s Adventure ). Lately, I’ve been particularly interested in teaching computer science. Currently, I’m most active in integrating artificial intelligence and data analytics into schools: the Pumice project is funded through various grants by Slovenian ministries, Google, Tides, and the EU. Together with my wife, we translated CS Unplugged into Vidra (the Slovenian version). I’ve also taught Scratch to children in schools, I’m responsible for FRI organizing summer schools for elementary school students since summer 2013, I’ve participated in the Program Council of the Bebras Challenge, helped with initiatives like Code Week, lectured in teacher training workshops, and had fun with kids at the Znanstival science festival organized by the House of Experiments . As a child who first got his hands on a computer in the early 1980s, when everyone was playing Kontrabant (Smuggler), I can’t help but reprogram the game myself every few years.
